1. Merge Sort means divide an array into two parts sort them and merge  them.
2. Effective solution to reduce memory: don't create copy of an array into two another  array.
instead of that use referencing (use index - sort from start index to middle index)
than sort from middle index+1 to end index
3.  Merge array into another array(this tym we will need another aaray, we  cannot merge in the same array)
4. middle index = (si+ei)/2( in nodejs we don't have integer type so if si+ei % 2 != 0 do +1

Merge Sort uses recursive Method

empty array means = si> ei
single element array = si == ei


Ultimately, the choice between Quicksort and Mergesort depends on the specific requirements of your task. 
If you need a stable sorting algorithm or you are dealing with very large datasets, Mergesort may be a better choice. 
If you need a faster algorithm for smaller datasets, Quicksort may be the better option.


recurence Relation = T(n) = T(n/2) + T(n/2) + n
time complexity = o(nlogn){best, Avg, worst}
space complexity o(n)

inplace algorithm,

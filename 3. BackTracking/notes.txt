Backtracking and recursion are two related concepts used in programming and problem-solving, 
but they serve different purposes.

Recursion:
Recursion is a programming technique where a function calls itself to solve a problem by 
breaking it down into smaller, similar subproblems. In a recursive function, the function 
repeatedly invokes itself with different inputs until it reaches a base case that doesn't 
require further recursive calls. Recursion is characterized by self-reference and the ability 
to solve complex problems by dividing them into simpler instances. 
It is widely used in various algorithms and data structures.

Backtracking:
Backtracking is a specific algorithmic technique used to solve problems by exploring all 
possible solutions incrementally. It involves trying out different options and undoing 
(backtracking) certain decisions if they lead to a dead-end or are not optimal. 
Backtracking is often used in problems where we need to find one or all possible solutions 
satisfying certain constraints. It systematically explores the solution space, discarding 
choices that don't meet the desired criteria.

The main difference between backtracking and recursion is their purpose and how they 
handle the problem-solving process. Recursion is a general programming technique that 
involves breaking down a problem into smaller subproblems and solving them recursively. 
Backtracking, on the other hand, is a specific algorithmic approach that uses recursion 
to explore all possible solutions to a problem by trying different options and undoing 
choices if needed.

It's worth noting that backtracking can be implemented using recursion. 
In fact, recursion is commonly used in backtracking algorithms to explore different paths or 
choices in a systematic manner. Backtracking can be seen as a specialized form of recursion
that focuses on exploring and finding solutions through a trial-and-error approach.
